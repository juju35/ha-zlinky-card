# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changes
- Header icon: the drawn Linky tile is replaced by an electric meter icon in a round badge tinted with the load color, like the other cards (40 px, 32 px on the mini card). `show_logo: false` still hides it.
- The Last 24 h and Phases section titles have a leading 16 px icon, like the other cards' section titles; the peak ("max 2,405 VA") stays on the right.
- The main power value is 30 px (was 32 px), like the other cards' main value; 24 px on the mini card as before.
- Header geometry: the body starts 8 px under the header (was 12 px); badge 12 px from the top and left edges, status pill 12 px from the right edge (detail button 8 px on the mini card).
